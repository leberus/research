	* TLB prefetching techniques:

		* Sequential Prefetching: Prefetches the previous and next page table entries based
		on the current reference.
			
		* Recency based Prefetching: This works on the principle that pages references at around the same
		time in the past will also be referenced at around the same time in the future.
		LRU stack is used to implement this.
		It maintains a logical ordering of accesses: most recent translations are at the top and the least
		recent ar at the bottom.

		* Distance base Prefetching:
